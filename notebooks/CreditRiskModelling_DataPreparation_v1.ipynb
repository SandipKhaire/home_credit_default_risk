    "- For a measure of association between categorical and numerical variables ,we have correleation ratio.It is a measure of the correlation between a categorical column and a numeric column. It measures the variance of the mean of the numeric column across different categories of the categorical column. Unlike the Pearson and Spearman Correlations, the Correlation Ratio is unable to measure the “direction” of the correlation, and can only measure its magnitude. It can take values between 0 and 1. A value of 1 indicates that the variance in the numeric data is purely due to the difference within the categorical data. A value of 0 indicates that the variance in the numeric data is completely unaffected by any differences within the categorical data"
